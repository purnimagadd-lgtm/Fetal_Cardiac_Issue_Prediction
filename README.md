Congenital cardiac issues in newborns, occurring before or after birth, may stem from factors such as maternal diet, medication, or genetic predispositions. Traditional diagnostic methods like ultrasound, 2D imaging, and tissue Doppler imaging assess heart structure and function but often fall short in accurate prediction and classification due to limited parameters like pulse and heart size, compounded by a lack of specialized expertise. This project leverages machine learning to enhance the prediction and classification of fetal cardiac issues using historical medical records. By employing supervised learning algorithms—Decision Tree, Linear Regression, and Random Forest—the system analyzes patterns in data to predict potential cardiac problems with improved accuracy over conventional methods. The model compares input parameters from medical reports against trained datasets to identify the type of cardiac issue and recommend tailored interventions, including diet, medication, or treatments based on patient symptoms. This approach aims to provide a robust, data-driven tool to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and management of fetal cardiac conditions.
